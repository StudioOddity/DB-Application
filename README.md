# DB-Application
All features should be fully functioning now. Dropdowns are now in place instead of input text fields per Professor Hou's recommendation. Professor's name is no longer used as an input on the professor section of the site; instead, the name is grabbed from the username of the login (username therefore must correspond to a matching entry in the MySQL database). <br>
**NOTE: To make sure the username for professor works properly, run the command** ***python manage.py migrate sessions*** **before running the server.**
